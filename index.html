            <p>
                At the intersection of Computational Biology, Biophysical Chemistry, and Artificial Intelligence, I work with Prof. B. Jayaram to unravel the complexities of eukaryotic genomic sequences. I aim to decode gene structural elements like exon-intron junctions, enhancers, untranslated regions, codons, and promoters, transforming them into meaningful insights.<br>
                Channelling my inner Dr Jack Hodgins—famously known as the "Bug Boy" (much to his dismay) from Bones—I dive into genomic data with the same enthusiasm and curiosity he brings to his lab. Just as Hodgins exclaims, “King of the lab”, when uncovering critical evidence, I’m driven by the thrill of solving the complex puzzles of the genome. My passion lies in deciphering the biological mysteries of functional elements within the genome, a quest that often keeps me up at night.<br>
                One area that particularly intrigues me involves DNA signals. Thousands of regions within the human genome feature stretches of DNA that are repeated a variable number of times. These simple DNA sequence repeats are known to cause numerous human diseases, many of which are primarily brain disorders. Exploring the interface of Computational Genomics and brain disorders is a thin line I’m eager to walk in the future.<br>
                DNA repeats offer a unique opportunity to study genetic effects on human biology, revealing clear quantitative relationships between DNA variation (number of repeats), cellular phenotypes, and human conditions such as disease. In essence, I’m currently focused on:
            <h3>Topics of interest:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Biophysical Profiling of Eukaryotic Genome Elements</li>
                <li>Developement of novel pipelines for deciphering the genome</li>
                <li>Machine learning in Genome Annotation</li>
                <li>Gene Markers in Early-/Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease Progression</li>
                <li>Spatial/Single-cell-omics to better translate Gene Expression at cellular level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I graduated with a BS in Life Science (Botany, Chemistry, Zoology) at the University of Delhi in 2021 and obtained an MS in Bioinformatics at the Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, India, in 2023. <br> In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing poetry, and planning my days beforehand.
