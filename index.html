            <p>
                Hi, I work at the intersection of Computational Biology, Biophysical Chemistry, and Artificial Intelligence under the supervision of Prof. B. Jayaram. Driven by the thrill of solving the complex puzzles within the genome, my passion lies in deciphering the biological mysteries of functional elements within the genome—a quest that often keeps me up at night.<br>
                I’m working at SCFBio on establishing a universal characterization framework for a Genome Workbench to identify and predict various genomic elements in eukaryotes. My previous work involved the Biophysical Fingerprinting of eukaryotic genomic elements across four kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista. This research enhanced our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms that govern genomic function and highlighted the potential of these signals as reliable markers for the efficient annotation of genomic elements across different organisms and kingdoms.<br>
                I am also deeply intrigued by neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and its progression. I previously conducted a Gene-to-Drug molecular dynamics simulations-based study that identified a single drug candidate targeting a group of key genes (APP, BACE1, APOE, GSK3B, MAPT, PSEN1) implicated in Alzheimer's disease.<br>
                Additionally, as part of my Master’s dissertation, I contributed to developing a novel tool, ChemEXIN, for predicting Exon-Intron boundaries. While Computational Genomics has allowed me to explore the genome beyond the .FASTA and .gtf/.gff formats as a Bioinformatician, I know I still have a long road ahead of me.<br>
                I firmly believe that in science, no data is ever wasted. The most exciting part of my work is solving problems and not giving up on the data.<br>
                In the future, I aspire to make significant contributions to the field of neurodegenerative disease research by leveraging my expertise in computational genomics. I am enthusiastic about the potential to unveil new insights into the human genome and beyond, and I am eager to continue my research journey, fueled by a passion for exploration and a dedication to advancing our understanding of life at its most fundamental level.

                I graduated with a BS in Life Science (Botany, Chemistry, Zoology) at the University of Delhi in 2021 and obtained an MS in Bioinformatics at the Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, India, in 2023. <br> In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing poetry, and planning my days beforehand.
