                Hi, I’m Danish. I work at the intersection of Computational Genomics and Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. B Jayaram. My main motivation right now is deciphering the biophysical translation of eukaryotic genome sequence-based information into computational signals, thereby, presenting applications with real-world impact. I love the interdisciplinary nature of computational biology as it borrows concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and computer science. Below are some of the topics I am curious about and hope to contribute and develop my projects on.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Genome architecture in eukaryotes exhibits high complexity. Amidst the numerous intricacies, genes as non-continuous stretches composed of exons and introns has garnered significant attention and curiosity among researchers. Accurate identification of exon-intron boundary junctions is crucial to decipher the molecular biology governing gene expression of regular and aberrant splicing. The currently employed frameworks for genomic signals, which aim to identify exons and introns within a genomic segment, need to be revised primarily due to the lack of a robust consensus sequence and the limitations posed by the training on available experimental data sets. To tackle these challenges and capitalize on the understanding that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) exhibits function-dependent local structural and energetic variations, we present ChemEXIN, an innovative method for predicting exon-intron boundaries. The method utilizes a deep-learning (DL) model alongside tri- and tetra-nucleotide-based structural and energy parameters. ChemEXIN surpasses current methods in accuracy and reliability. Our work represents a significant advancement in exon-intron boundary annotations, with potential implications for understanding gene expression, regulation, and biomedical research.

            <h3>Ongoing Projects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Physico-chemical fingerprinting of Genomic elements. Working with the hypothesis that genomic DNA sequences must convey their functional roles through their biophysical properties. We are characterising Promoters, Exon-start, Exon-end, Enhancers, UTRs and CDS to differentiate them on the basis of their structure and energy profiles.</li>
