                I am interested in decoding disease biology through the lens of data. My focus is on integrating multiple layers, such as multiomics, medical records, and imaging, to uncover predictive markers and risk scores for complex diseases, including dementia, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. I am particularly drawn to <b>multimodal</b> data integration and machine learning as ways to address complex biological problems in meaningful and interpretable ways.<br><br>
                At the Supercomputing Facility for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SCFBio), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, I work at the intersection of computational biology, biophysical chemistry, and artificial intelligence under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=TK_7VNIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"><b>Prof. B. Jayaram</b></a>. I am co-developing a Genome Workbench, a framework based on genomic physical fingerprinting to identify and predict regulatory and structural elements such as promoters, enhancers, gene boundaries, and exon–intron junctions in eukaryotes. Earlier, I contributed to a large-scale study that profiled about 4.6 million genomic elements across four kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista), which revealed distinct biophysical signals that can guide eukaryotic genome annotation. As part of my Master’s dissertation, I also co-developed <a href="https://github.com/rnsharma478/ChemEXIN"><b>ChemEXIN</b></a>, a tool for predicting exon–intron boundaries using the physicochemical properties of DNA in humans, mice, and worms.<br><br>
                In parallel, I serve as a <b>Bioinformatics Associate</b> at the <a href="https://www.iari.res.in/sci_db/sci_details.php?scid=Vmw2dkJlYUttT0tWQkxQT3ZwcDlYQT09">Division of Plant Physiology</a>, <a href="https://www.iari.res.in/en/index.php">Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)</a>b Delhi</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.iari.res.in/sci_db/sci_details.php?scid=Vmw2dkJlYUttT0tWQkxQT3ZwcDlYQT09"><b>Dr. Renu Pandey</b></a>. My work focuses on the genome-wide identification of Phosphate Starvation Response 1-like binding (P1BS) elements in rice promoters. I developed a custom motif-finding pipeline and combined it with RNA-seq-based expression analysis to study gene regulation under abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, heat, and cold.<br><br>
                Earlier, at the <a href="https://www.kraza.in/">Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics lab</a>, I conceptualized and carried out a gene-to-drug molecular dynamics study that identified a small molecule candidate capable of simultaneously targeting multiple key genes (APP, BACE1, APOE, GSK3B, MAPT, PSEN1) implicated in Alzheimer’s disease.<br><br>
                Across all of these projects, one constant has been my relationship with data—I see every dataset as an opportunity to ask new questions, integrate multiple perspectives, and draw biological meaning. I believe no dataset is ever wasted; some simply take longer to reveal their story. 
            <h3>Topics of interest:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrative analysis of multimodal datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, medical records, imaging) for disease risk and biomarker prediction</li>
                <li>Machine learning and deep learning approaches for predictive genomics and functional element classification</li>
                <li>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and downstream integration to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers</li>
                <li>Neurogenomics and disease progression studies, with a focus on dementia, Alzheimer’s, and other complex disorders</li>
                <li>Data-driven research design, emphasizing dataset integration, and interpretability across biological layers</li>
                <li>Spatial and single-cell -omics to decode gene regulation at the cellular resolution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I graduated with a B.Sc. in Life Science (Botany, Chemistry, Zoology) at the <a href="https://www.du.ac.in/"><b>University of Delhi</b></a> in 2021 and obtained an M.Sc. in Bioinformatics at the Department of Computer Science, <a href="https://jmi.ac.in/"><b>Jamia Millia Islamia</b></a> in 2023. <br> In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing poetry, and planning my days beforehand.
